Description:

This Lambda function is designed to optimize EBS storage costs by automatically identifying and deleting stale EBS snapshots. It scans for snapshots that are no longer associated with active EC2 instances, indicating they are redundant and can be safely removed.

Benefits:

Cost Reduction: Significantly reduces EBS storage costs by eliminating unnecessary snapshots.
Efficiency: Automates the snapshot cleanup process, saving time and effort.
Data Integrity: Ensures that only truly stale snapshots are deleted, preserving important data.
How it Works:

Snapshot Identification: The function fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the current account.
Volume Association Check: For each snapshot, it verifies if the associated volume is attached to an active EC2 instance.
Stale Snapshot Detection: If a snapshot's volume is not attached, it is considered stale.
Deletion: Stale snapshots are marked for deletion, ensuring they are removed safely and efficiently.
Implementation:

AWS Lambda: The function is deployed as a serverless Lambda function for scalable and efficient execution.
Boto3: The Python SDK for AWS is used to interact with EBS and EC2 services.
Configuration:

Trigger: The function can be triggered by a scheduled event or in response to other AWS events.
Permissions: Ensure the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to list and delete EBS snapshots.
